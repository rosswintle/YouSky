                            YouSky is a personal, private journal that works

                            Capture your thoughts in short social-media length

                            YouSky stores the data in your web browser. There is
                            no "cloud" or "server". Only you, in this web
                            broswer, on this device, can see what you post.
                            (Though you use entirely at your own risk and I'm
                            not responsible for what you do with it.)

                            You can (and it is recommended that you do) export
                            your posts using the menu in the top-right
                            occasionally to save them. This also allows you to
                            move your posts to another device.

                            YouSky has replies and hashtags and search that work
                            mostly as you would expect. It's not finished and
                            lacks some polish, but it works just fine today.
                            Expect it to work a bit better in the future.
